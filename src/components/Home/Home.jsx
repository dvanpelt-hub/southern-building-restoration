          <h3>Services</h3>
          <p>
            We have completed conservation work on all types of Historic and
            Listed properties from vernacular Tudor cottages to grand Georgian
            mansions. Preservation of original fabric is always at the forefront
            and vision of our work, taking necessary and logical steps in our
            work to achieve this. The understanding that every property and
            building is different is an important approach in how the work is
            carried out to ensure the best possible results.

            Harbon Builders was originally established in 1968, mostly serving
            the alteration and new build sector. Having encountered Listed and
            Historic Buildings we have developed an interest in how 'old'
            properties work and how to maintain them. Now Harbon Builders solely
