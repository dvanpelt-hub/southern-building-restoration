          <h3>Lime plastering and rendering</h3>
          <p>
            SBR offers comprehensive lime plastering and rendering services,
            specializing in the restoration and conservation of historic
            buildings. Lime plastering is an essential technique for preserving
            the authenticity and structural integrity of period properties, and
            SBR’s expert craftsmen are skilled in applying traditional
            lime-based plasters and renders to both interior and exterior
            surfaces. Unlike modern cement-based products, lime plaster is
            breathable and flexible, allowing buildings to maintain proper
            moisture regulation and preventing long-term damage. SBR uses the
            finest quality lime products and combines them with time-tested
            methods to ensure the aesthetic and functional performance of each
            restoration project. Whether it’s refreshing the finish on a period
            property or undertaking more extensive lime plastering works, SBR
            delivers meticulous and long-lasting results.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to traditional plastering, SBR’s lime rendering services
            play a vital role in the conservation of historical facades. Lime
            render provides a durable, weather-resistant coating that allows
            moisture to escape from the building, protecting the underlying
            structure from damp and decay. The team at SBR is highly experienced
            in applying lime render to a wide range of surfaces, including
            stone, brick, and timber. Their careful approach ensures that the
            character of the building is preserved while enhancing its
            longevity. From delicate internal lime plastering to robust external
            rendering, SBR offers a full range of lime-based services, providing
            expert solutions to maintain and restore the beauty of historic
            properties for future generations.

          <h3>Lime pointing</h3>
          <p>
            SBR specializes in all aspects of lime pointing, offering expert
            services designed to preserve and protect the integrity of historic
            buildings and structures. Lime pointing is a traditional technique
            used to repoint mortar joints in brick and stonework, and SBR excels
            in this highly skilled process. Unlike modern cement-based mortar,
            lime mortar is breathable, flexible, and much more sympathetic to
            the natural materials of older buildings. SBR’s team understands the
            importance of using the right mix and application techniques to
            match the original material, ensuring the longevity and structural
            stability of period properties. Whether it’s repointing a building’s
            facade or repairing joints on smaller features, SBR provides a
            professional and precise service that respects the craftsmanship of
            the past.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a deep understanding of historic masonry, SBR’s lime pointing
            services not only improve the aesthetic appeal of a building but
            also enhance its performance. Lime mortar allows moisture to escape,
            preventing the trapped moisture that can cause damage in modern
            cement-based systems. SBR uses the best quality lime products and
            employs traditional methods to ensure that each project is completed
            to the highest standards. From minor repointing repairs to larger
            conservation projects, SBR’s lime pointing services are an essential
            part of maintaining and restoring the beauty and function of
            historic properties for years to come.

          <h3>Paint removal and surface cleaning</h3>
          <p>
            SBR specializes in non-permeable paint removal from historic fabric, providing careful and precise solutions that prioritize the preservation of the original materials. Over time, non-permeable paints can trap moisture within the fabric of a building, leading to deterioration and damage to the underlying stone, brick, or timber. SBR’s team employs advanced, non-invasive techniques to remove these paints without compromising the condition of the historic surfaces. By using methods such as steam cleaning, chemical gel treatments, or gentle abrasive blasting, SBR ensures that the original fabric is exposed and protected, allowing the building’s natural materials to breathe again and preventing future damage. This restoration process not only helps to restore the aesthetic of the building but also contributes to its long-term stability and health.
            <br />
            <br />
            In their approach to paint removal, SBR is committed to maintaining the integrity of the historic fabric while achieving the best possible results. Their focus is on minimizing disruption to the original materials and retaining the character of the property. With a deep understanding of the challenges involved in working with older structures, SBR carefully assesses each project to select the most appropriate technique, ensuring that no damage is caused during the process. The end result is a beautifully restored surface that showcases the natural materials and craftsmanship of the period, while safeguarding the building’s future preservation. SBR’s paint removal services are an essential part of maintaining the authenticity and heritage of historic buildings.
